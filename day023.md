## JugsMugsPugsPlus and Reverse
## Write a program that receives a number on the input.
## It also should receive another boolean value 'rev' on the input. 

##   - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
##   - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
##   - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

##   - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
##        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
##  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
##        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
##   - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
##         - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"
## Otherwise, it prints the number.

## REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
## If the boolean 'rev' is True, then reverse the order of printing. 
##    - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
##    - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
##    - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
##    - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
